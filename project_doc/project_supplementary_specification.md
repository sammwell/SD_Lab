# (Project Name) Supplementary Specification

# Introduction
[The introduction of the Supplementary Specification provides an overview of the entire document.
The Supplementary Specification captures the system requirements that are not readily captured in the use cases of the use-case model. Such requirements include:
Legal and regulatory requirements, including application standards.
Quality attributes of the system to be built, including usability, reliability, performance, and supportability requirements.
Other requirements such as operating systems and environments, compatibility requirements, and design constraints.]

# Non-functional Requirements

[Define system quality attributes in terms of scenarios according to the following template:
-	Quality attribute definition
-	Source of stimulus: the entity (human or another system) that generated the stimulus or event
-	Stimulus: a condition that determines a reaction of the system
-	Environment: the current condition of the system when the stimulus arrives
-	Artifact: is a component that reacts to the stimulus. It may be the whole system or some pieces of it
-	Response: the activity determined by the arrival of the stimulus
-	Response measure: the quantifiable indication of the response
-	Tactics

## Availability
## Performance
## Security
## Testability
## Usability

# Design Constraints
[This section needs to indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered to. Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased components, class libraries, and so on.]
