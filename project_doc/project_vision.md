# Stakeholder and User Descriptions
To effectively provide products and services that meet your stakeholders’ and users' real needs, it is necessary to identify and involve all of the stakeholders as part of the Requirements Modeling process. You must also identify the users of the system and ensure that the stakeholder community adequately represents them. This section provides a profile of the stakeholders and users involved in the project, and the key problems that they perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution. It does not describe their specific requests or requirements as these are captured in a separate stakeholder requests artifact. Instead, it provides the background and justification for why the requirements are needed.
