# Assignment 2

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to allow students to become familiar with the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and the Factory Method design pattern.

## Application Description
Use Java or C# to design and implement a desktop application for an Invoice System. The application should have two types of users (a regular user and an administrator user) which have to provide a username and a password in order to use the application.

The regular user can perform the following operations:
* CRUD on invoices (an invoice has client, beneficiary, price, items, etc)
* CRUD on the list of clients which are linked to each invoice
* Generate two types of files, one in pdf format and one in txt or html format, with the contents of the invoice. The files **need** to be saved in a **user-selected location** (not predefined by the application), similar on how one would save a file from Notepad.

The administrator can perform the following operations:
* CRUD on regular users' information.

## Application Constraints
* The data used in the application will be stored in a database, using an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) framework.
* Use the Model-View-Controller (or Model-View-ViewModel if using WPF) in designing the application. It's **mandatory** that the Controllers/ViewModels don't have direct reference to the View class (e.g., the one that inherits from JFrame or JPanel), but through an interface if really needed.
* Use the Factory Method design pattern for generating the reports (i.e., selecting between the type of report to generate).
* All the inputs of the application will be validated against invalid data before submitting the data and saving it.
* Unit test the **users-related** controller(s)/view model(s) using a testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit). Use a Mocking framework (e.g., Mockito, Moq) to mock dependencies on repositories/views. The tests **should not** need nor have direct access to the database.

## Requirements
* Implement and test the application.
* Commit the work you do on your Git repository. Do it **iteratively** as you progress, not all at a time (this will incur a penalty on your final mark).

# Assignment 3

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to allow students to become familiar with the client-server architectural style and the Observer design pattern.

## Application Description
Start from the previous application, done as assignment 2.

Transform the application into a client-server one. The layer that did the persistence should be moved to the server, and the client can only retrieve that data by communicating with the server. Most of the business logic needs to be on the server side, unless something is needed to be client-side (e.g., report generator)

At a given time, there can be multiple users connected via multiple clients to the same server.

New features:
* The regular user has a limit of 5 invoices per day, unless he buys more uses. He can request another batch of 2 to the admin
* The admin can approve/reject the requests of the users.
* An user gets a live notification when the admin approved/rejected the extra uses.

## Application Constraints
* The application should be client-server and the data on the server will be stored in a database. Use the Observer design pattern for the live notifications (usually this is done server-side, because it's there where we know the list of clients). The notifications should **only** be done for the currently connected clients; so if a relevant client is not online, he won't get the live notification
* All the inputs of the application will be validated against invalid data before submitting the data and saving it.
* Unit test the invoice-related controller(s)/view model(s) using a testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit). Use a Mocking framework (e.g., Mockito, Moq) to mock dependencies on repositories/views/server connection. The tests **should not** need direct access to the client or the server.

## Requirements
* Implement and test the application.
* Commit the work you do on your Git repository. Do it **iteratively** as you progress, not all at a time (this will incur a penalty on your final mark).

# Final Project

## Objective
This is the final part of the project, which aims at completing the overall application as envisioned by the Vision document.

## Application Description
Start from the previous application, done as assignment 2 and 3.

Final features:
* The user can purchase a subscription instead of paying incrementally for each batch of 5 invoices per day. There are three types: 7/10/15 per day. These are bought from a virtual wallet, that is refilled by the admin.
* The user can archive several selected invoices, generating a zip archive.
* The user can now send invoices through email, to a specific email address of client's

## Application Constraints
* All the inputs of the application will be validated against invalid data before submitting the data and saving it.
* Apply one of the design patterns (excluding: Singleton, Factory Method, Observer, Builder) you described in Project Analysis and Design Iteration 1.2
* Ensure that your code doesn't violate any good practices/conventions nor has any issues as detected by the following tools:
  * Java code: [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/#windows) - rulesets/java/quickstart.xml,category/java/bestpractices.xml
  * C# code: [ReSharper Command Line Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html#section=resharper-clt)
* Unit test most of the functionality of the application, so it reaches at least **60%** code coverage. Use a Mocking framework (e.g., Mockito, Moq) to mock dependencies where needed.

## Requirements
* Implement and test the application.
* Commit the work you do on your Git repository. Do it **iteratively** as you progress, not all at a time (this will incur a penalty on your final mark).
* Put the report of running those validation applications in the project's directory.
* Complete "Iteration 2" and "Construction and Transition" sections of the project_analysis_and_design.md document with the final data, updating the diagrams where it seems necessary.
* Make sure the repository is clean of irrelevant files, and respects the structure.
